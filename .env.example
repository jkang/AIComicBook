# Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following:

```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Note**: Environment variables in Vite must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the client-side code.

## Vercel Deployment

When deploying to Vercel, add the environment variable in your project settings:
- Key: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Value: Your Gemini API key
